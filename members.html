                <h2>Sui Feng Xu</h2>
                <p>I am Sui Feng. I am known as Mr.Canada because I spent about ten years of my life there where I discovered the activity of Quiz Bowl. After arriving in San Ramon at the begining of 9th grade, I was a little confused by the American system of education.  Luckily, I found the right direction and was able to found Quiz Bowl my junior year. If you have any questions about the club or Quiz Bowl in general, I will be more than happy to explain it to you.  For those who hesitate whether trivia is for you, I want to tell you my personal experience: "You do know more than you think!".  The club is not about memorizing random facts but is about having fun noticing what you are capable of.

                <h2>Cody Zeng</h2>
                <p> Hello, I'm Cody! I am the most mature and hard working member on the team. My favorite sports teams are the San Antonio Spurs, Oklahoma City Thunder, and FC Bayern Munich. My favorite button layout is tactical and my favorite video games are Battlefield, GTA, and 2k since I can play as my favorite team, the Spurs. My favorite mode of transportation is by plane and my favorite subjects include history and biology. I specialize in all subjects on the team, but my favorite areas are art and history.  My favorite color is green and if you juxtapose my bio with the person before me, it is evident that I am more professional in not only my grammar but also by vocabulary. However, that is none of my business whatsoever.

                <h2>Samuel Zhang</h2>
                <p>  
                Samuel Zhang is one of those cool kids who likes to think he's all that. The true rebel inside of him breaks out and wants to start break dancing instead when heâ€™s told to write a hundred words for a measly online biography, but he still does it, in true devotion to the adoring fans of his brilliant future.  When he gets bored, he likes to debate the best and brightest philosopher of this millennium (himself) on the meaning of plant life. When he gets really bored, he sits in a refrigerator and pretends he's exploring ice cliffs in Antarctica.

                <p>
                	Hi. My name is Eric Chen. I'm quite notorious for my outfit - T-Shirt and shorts, rain or shine. My favorite colors are orange and blue. I support Arsenal FC, Kotoshogiku, St. Kilda, Calgary Stampeders, San Franciso 49ers, Iceland Handball team, Norway Women's Handball team, Los Angeles Lakers, Croatia football team, and Cal rugby team. My favorite chess opening is the polar bear system in the leningrad dutch. I like elephants and other fat mammals. A few of my favorite foods are eggplant and cheese. I only read non-fiction books because real life is more interesting than fiction. Three more words.

                <p style="color:rgb(0,0,128);font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:12px;">
                        Victor Chan, the Secretary of Haarlem Quiz Bowl, is a junior at Dougherty Valley High School. While he isn't studying for school, he enjoys robotics and solving all types of Rubik's Cubes. His favorite color is yellow and his favorite font is Century Gothic (not Comic Sans for SURE). During Quiz Bowl tournaments, Victor [somewhat] answers questions related to math, science, and anything he recognizes from Wikipedia cramming. Whenever he writes about himself, he does so in omniscient third-person and with deplorable diction destructive to the diaphragm of anyone attempting to assert his alliterations.

                <p> 
<p> Chief of the Propagation of Club Propaganda, Yashasvi Sharma is a juniour at Dougherty Valley High School. When he is not attempting to get a 2500 on the SAT and a 39 on the ACT, he programmes video games, takes part in International Political Simulations, and attempting to learn Dene-Yenisian glottology. Yashasvi Sharma usually answers questions relating to history, politics, geography, philosophy, mathematics, and computer science, as well as any information that can be garnered from the The Book of Useless Information ($11.99 including tax at Barnes and Nobles). As Chief of the Propagation of Club Propaganda, Yashasvi Sharma finds that his omnipresent power does not create him into a narcissistic, megalomaniac, autocrat who wishes for all to praise and clap after he finishes speaking. You may clap now.
