        	<h2>What is Quiz Bowl, and Why Should I Join?</h2>

             <span class="tab"></span><img src="images/chicago groupie.jpg" alt="" class="floatPicRight" width="20%" height="20%">  Quiz bowl is an academic competition resembling the popular game show Jeopardy! It is played between two teams of 1-4 players which earn points by answering questions in various subjects, like science, history, literature, and fine arts. There are two types of questions in quiz bowl - tossups and bonuses. Tossups are open to both teams and consist of progressively harder clues about a specific answer. The first player who knows the answer buzzes in, and if they're right, their team gets 10 points. If they're wrong, their team loses 5 points and can't buzz again on on the same question. The winning team for each tossup then receives 3 bonus questions, each worth 10 points, that they can work together to answer. After 20 tossups, the team with more points wins.

             <br><br>

             <span class="tab"></span> Quiz bowl is played from the middle school to the college level. High school quiz bowl is extremely popular, with thousands of teams competing in numerous local and regional tournaments every year to qualify for the two national championships - The High School National Championship Tournament (HSNCT), run by National Academic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT), the and National Scholastics Championship (NSC), run by The Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence (PACE). NAQT also hosts the MSNCT for the top middle school teams around the country.
