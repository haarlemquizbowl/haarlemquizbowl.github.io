                <span class="tab"></span>Hello, everyone! I am Sir Samuel of San Ramon, the self-proclaimed master historian of this wonderful empire, the great club known as The Official Quiz Bowl Team of Dougherty Valley High School, of the years 2014 and 2015. 

                <br><br>

                <span class="tab"></span>Quiz Bowl first came to Dougherty Valley in the school year of 2012 to 2013, when the then-seniors of Science Bowl gathered with a sophomore named Eric Chen to play at the local Californian Cup, a regular tournament hosted by UC Berkeley. Though they were second in the state for science, they performed only modestly in Quiz Bowl—not of course, in any insult to their skill or aptitude. Quiz Bowl is just a different kind of competition though, one that tests all subjects across the spectrum of American education, and then a bit further. 

                <br><br>

                <span class="tab"></span>The official club that serves Dougherty Valley today became the brainchild of Sui Feng Xu during the summer of 2013, which he first messaged two friends. One of them was Cody Zeng, who would later become co-president; the other, Daniel Zhang, introduced him to another unrelated friend named Samuel Zhang. Together, with Eric Chen and the youngest member of the Science Bowl team, Bibhav Poudel, they would soon form the first official A Team of Dougherty Valley Quiz Bowl, a team that would later make it to nationals—and become one of the 200 best teams in the nation, in the first year of its creation. 

                <br><br>

                <span class="tab"></span>As for the next chapter in our journey—well, it’s up to you.
