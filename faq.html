            <em><strong>Q: Does it cost to be in Haarlem Quiz Bowl?</strong></em>
            <p>A: It does not cost anything to join and to attend the practices. However, we require the members to pay a determined amount for each tournament, as it required by the host, and we encourage you to pay a donation at the begining of the year to allow you to get discounts for each tournament.</p>

            <em><strong>Q: How many hours of involvement will I be required to put in Quiz Bowl?</strong></em>
            <p>A: We do not force any of our members to study but we recommend to attend the weekly meeting and to study about three hours per week.  The effort that you put in your study will show up in tournaments.  A perfect example is Cody Zeng, the Co-President who only discovered Quiz Bowl last year, and became an important player for the team A after spending numerous hours studying.</p>

            <em><strong>Q: What is the difference between Science Bowl and Quiz Bowl?</strong></em>
            <p>A: Science Bowl and Quiz Bowl, although both played with buzzers, have completely different rules. Quiz Bowl questions are a lot longer and have "pyramid difficulty" (clues get easier as the question is read). In addition, the scoring is a lot different. For every toss up in quiz bowl, it is worth 10 points. If the toss up is correct, you have the choice to answer a three part bonus worth 10 points each. This is different from science bowl since each toss up is worth four points and you only have the opportunity to answer a one part bonus worth 14 points. But most importantly, whereas  science bowl solely focuses on math and science, quiz bowl focuses on all areas of academics so there will always be something for everyone!</p>
